# Web Application Development


This programme is designed to give a rapid introduction to
building web applications. It has a strong focus on the data and
back-end services required to provide a rich end-user experience.

While it does not set out to develop strong front-end design and user
experience skills, the basics of HTML, JavaScript and CSS will be
covered. At the end of the programme, learners should be ready to join
a development team.  The programme uses Python and Django, but the
concepts learned can be transferred to work with other languages and
frameworks.

# Learning Outcomes

At the end of the programme, each learner will have:

 - worked with python to create solutions to non-trivial problems.
 - created test suites capable of testing individual functions as well
   as aspects of a web application.
 - worked with the Jinja2 template language to create user interfaces
   that expose relevant data in an appropriate manner.
 - worked with data stored in a database through simple SQL and an
   ORM, capable of being updated after deployment.
 - created an API for access to relevant data and used that API by
   making asynchronous requests that update information displayed to a
   user in a web page.
 - built a full functioning, documented and tested web application
   that is deployed to a cloud service.
 - run their own project as well as contributed to at least one
   of their peer's projects using git branches and pull requests.

 - Week 10: Deployment

### Weeks 1-2: The Development Environment

In the first part of the bootcamp we will become familiar with the
development environment and the programming language we will use for
the back-end development.  This includes learning about version
control with git, virtual environments and containerisation with
docker.

### Weeks 3-4: Testing and Data

The bootcamp now moves on to good practices for documentation and testing, as well as structuring data in a database and accessing it in a way that makes it easier to incorporate in our web application.

### Weeks 5-6

Weeks 5 and 6 introduce the Django framework that will allow us to build web applications rapidly and in line with standards and user expectations.  We will use CSS and HTML as well as the Jinja2 templating language so that we can create rich pages that bring data from the back-end to the user.

### Weeks 7-8

In weeks 7 and 8 we look will look at more custom content and begin building our own individual apps.

### Weeks 9-10

In the final weeks of the bootcamp we look at making much more dynamic interfaces that can access the database without having to refresh the page. The final week will be spent polishing the web app and adding finishing touches ready for deployment.
